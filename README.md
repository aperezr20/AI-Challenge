# AI-Challenge

This is a repo for an open AI challenge held by Arkangel AI. The problems stands as follows:

> As a Machine Learning Engineer at Arkangel AI, you receive a project from a biometric data company. This project aims to develop a computer vision model to be able to recognize the workers of a company while detecting the emotion or feeling of each individual. The biometric data company that hires Arkangel AI only imposes two requirements, which are: First, the number of workers will be fixed and to obtain a database, each individual can be asked for several photographs with which to develop the model. And as a second, the developed model must be deployed in the cloud to be able to make inferences to it, from any physical point where the system is deployed. However, this deployment can be done programmatically or through a UI, as Arkangel AI provides.

> As a deliverable, a live demo of the deployed model must be made, as well as a short presentation of the different implemented architectures explaining the reason for the model selection. It is a very important client that has a time constraint, for this reason there is a period of X days to carry out this project until a first functional prototype with its respective deliverable.

To submit your solution, please generate a PR to this repository by generating a new folder with the name and date of the proposed solution.
